The grebes swim side by side, bobbing dipping their heads in unison and grooming their feathers. To strengthen their bond he offers her a gift of freshly caught fish. With eyes only for one another the faithful pair reach the climax of their dance. Lowering their heads in preparation they paddle their feet to lift themselves out of he water and dance along the surface together.
